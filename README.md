## Working on this project has been amazing. Despite all the challenges I faced, I'm proud of it as a whole, even if it can be improved.
### Let me give you a short introduction to this simple project. It is a blog website for tech enthusiasts from all walks of life. It starts with the user landing on the page in the picture above, and then they log in or register. It features a page for entering all the details for your blog article that you want to share, with picture upload functionality and a title for the page.
